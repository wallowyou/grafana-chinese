## Published guides

For all items not covered in this guide, refer to the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) and the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html).

## Grafana-specific style

### General

* Use active voice. Avoid passive voice.
  - Passive: The heatmap visualization is displayed.
  - Active: Grafana displays the heatmap visualization.
* Write in the imperative second person. Examples: You can write a query. Click the panel. Close the window.
* Write in present tense.
  - Not: The panel will open.
  - Use: The panel opens. Grafana opens the panel.
* Do not use an ampersand (&) as an abbreviation for "and." 
  - **Exceptions:** If an ampersand is used in the Grafana UI, then match the UI.

### File naming conventions

- Files that are displayed in the help system should have names that are all lowercase, no spaces. Use hyphens instead of spaces. Example: glossary.md
- Documentation file names should match the title. **Note:** This only applies to new files at this time. Do not change the names of older files unless directed to do so.
- Internal reference file names should be all uppercase except the file extension. Example: CONTRIBUTING.md

### Headings

* Write headings in sentence case, not title case.
  - This is sentence case
  - This Is Title Case
* Task topic headings start with a verb.
  - Write a query. Create a dashboard.
* Concept and reference topic headings should be nouns or gerunds. Examples: Contributing to docs, Visualizations, Style guide
* Avoid following one heading with another heading.
* Avoid skipping heading levels. For example, an h1 should be followed by an h2 rather than an h3.
* Avoid having just one lower-level heading. For example, h1, h2, h2, h3, h3, h2 is a good order. Do no go h1, h2, h3, h2, h3, h2.
* Don't include parenthetical words like (Important!) in headings.

### Images

* Preferred format is .png
* File extension should be all lowercase.
* Preferred DPI is 72.
* Assume all graphics will be exclusively viewed on the web.
* Maximum image size is 3840px X 2160px.
* Screenshots should be readable, but not too large.

### Capitalization

* Grafana, Loki, and Prometheus are always capitalized unless part of a code block.
* API names are always Title Case, followed by "API"â€”for example, "Dashboard Permissions API"
* Git is always capitalized, unless part of a code block.
* Abbreviations are always capitalized (such as API, HTTP, ID, JSON, SQL, or URL) unless they are part of a code block.

### Links and references

When referencing another document, use "Refer to" rather than alternatives such as "See" or "Check out."

Always give the reader some idea of what to expect in the reference. Avoid blind references, such as, "Refer to [this file](link)."

When possible, use the exact title of the page or section you are linking to as the link text.

**Example**
* Refer to the [Documentation style guide](documentation-style-guide.md) for information about word usage and capitalization guidelines.

### Word usage

Grafana products has some words, abbreviations, and slang particular to this discourse community.

* "Open source" should be hyphenated when used as an adjective, e.g. *open-source software*. The open form should be preferred when used as a noun, e.g. *Grafana is open source*.
* Use "data source" instead of "datasource" unless used as an identifier, in code, or as part of a URL.
* Spell out "repository" and avoid the shorter "repo."
